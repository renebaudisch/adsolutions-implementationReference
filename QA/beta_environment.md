# Using the Beta environment for display Ads

You can easily switch between our different development branches for the adlib by using our [Branch Switch](https://adtechnology.axelspringer.com/beta.php).


On our Branch Switch you can choose the branch, you like to test with. This happens via a cookie which will be checked from our ad delivery, to serve the instance of our adlib, that you checked in the tool.

Just select the branch you like to receive and set the timeframe in which the branch will stay active for you.
Lastly you just need to hit the "set branch" button and every page where our adlib is active, will deliver you the specified instance of the adlib.





### What Branch is right for me?

 
The most relevant Branches are:
 
 1. Master
    > *This is our live environment*
 
 
 2. Development
    >*This is our testing environment for new features that are already stable and tested in our alpha branch for a while*
 
 
 3. Alpha
    >*This is our testing environment for early developments of new features*
 
 
 4. A/B Test
    >*We use this branch to run A/B tests on new features*

 
 

### How do I know, that the branch really changed?

After setting the cookie, you can see via an adalert, on what branch you currently are. To make an Ad Alert, you can simply click into the page and write ```adalert```. Now there should open a small container with a lot of informations about the current ads on the page. On top right of the container, you should see the version of the adlib and directly below the active branch.


Remember to reload the page after changing the branch cookie, if you had the page already loaded in another tab.



### How to reset the Branch? 

After you are finished with testing the branch, you can simple delete the branch cookie by setting the branch back to ```Master```.
